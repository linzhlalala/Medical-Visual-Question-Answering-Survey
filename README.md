# Medical-Visual-Question-Answering-Survey

## A Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a combination of medical artificial intelligence and
popular VQA challenges. Given a medical image and a clinically relevant question in natural language,
the medical VQA system is expected to predict a plausible and convincing answer. Although the
general-domain VQA has been extensively studied, the medical VQA still needs specific investigation
and exploration due to its task features. In the first part of this survey, we cover and discuss the publicly
available medical VQA datasets up to date about the data source, data quantity, and task feature. In
the second part, we review the approaches used in medical VQA tasks. In the last part, we analyze
some medical-specific challenges for the field and discuss future research directions.
